Learn Finnish with me!

Inspired by my earlier Finnish-Language-Trainer, instead of just giving words and asking them, it actually divides them into lessons. Each lesson also has a recap of three words chosen at random. You can also check the vocab of each lesson.

Every lesson keeps track of your best grade, and also when you complete a lesson for the first time, you automatically unlock the next one.
